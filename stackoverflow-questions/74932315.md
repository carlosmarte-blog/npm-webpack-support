It would be hard to discern your architecture or data flow from the statement above. 

But I would say your current approach of reformatting the entire data structure to either be snake or camel as unnecessary. unless this data structure is being passed through functions and you have no control how it's retreated.

Reformatting the data structure requires a recursive loop. your time and complexity will increase as the data structure grows in size and nesting.

I would suggest that you create a function that wraps lo-dash.get and change-case. 

Exmaple: 
`getData(dataStructure, path, case, defaultValue);`

Formatting an entire data structure up front can be costly and cause performance issues
