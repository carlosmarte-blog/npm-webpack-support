By default, webpack will use `index.js` file in `src/index.js`. This may vary depending on the webpack version. 

Generally, its preferred to specify the entry files. Based on your question, I'm assuming you are trying to add additional files to webpack entry that would be parsed and build by webpack. 


This is handled by defining additional entry in webpack.config.js
https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/

``` lang-js
module.exports = {
  ...
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js',
    vendors: './src/vendors.js',
  },
  ...
};
```

In the example above, webpack will generate two files in `dist/`. 
1) `dist/main.js`
2) `dist/vendors.js`
